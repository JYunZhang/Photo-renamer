In this PhotoRenamer program, there are 13 button classes in total, which means that almost all the buttons in the PhotoRenamer has its own class. Separating every button in class is a good way to write the program clearly and avoid mess up all the actions of the buttons, which benefits both the programmer and the reader (such as me) because it helps to show the big picture of the whole GUI part of the program. However, I notice that TagAdderButton, TagDeleterButton and TagRemoverButton are all extend ListSelectionButton, so I think these three button classes could be deleted and add the specific action to the specific button in PhotoRenamer class when the buttons were created. Moreover, in my perspective, the ConfirmRenameButton might be not necessary because all the changes can be reverted and the users don’t have to be worried about renaming a photo wrongly. What’s more, the SeeLogButton and the RevertToButton is redundant in showing the old names of the photo, therefore, I think the SeeLogButton is not necessary. Other than these unnecessary buttons, the other button classes are clear, neat and useful. An alternative way to set the button instead of creating distinct classes is setting the actionPerform in the PhotoRenamer class when addAction to the specific button. However, this method would make chaos in the PhotoRenamer class, which obviously is an unwise way to apply actions to the buttons. Therefore, I am agree with the way that separating different kinds of buttons into different classes to make it easier in programming, reading and understanding. In conclusion, more classes does no harm to the program and having each declared in a separate file is a good way and good habit to write a program.
